Version 1.1.5 - 2023-11-21
----------------------------
Fixed:
- An emergency fix on program crash if a log file is not set with CLI.

Version 1.1.4 - 2023-11-18
----------------------------

- Fixed a bug causing segmentation fault on reading env->goal_locations when the plan timelimit exceeded.

Changes:
- Updated documentation to explain the preprocess timeout behaviour.
- Updated documentation to better explain online timeout behaviour. In particular, we spell out that env->curr_timestep may increment during the `plan()` call if it exceeds the given plan timelimit.

Version 1.1.3 - 2023-10-24
----------------------------
Added:
- Add Working_with_Preprocessed_Data.md to explain how you can work with your preprocessed data.
- Add Debug_and_Visualiser_Your_Planner.md to explain how you can use the JSON output to debug and visualise with PlanViz
  
Changed:
- Additional option `OutputScreen` in the input argument, which allows you to choose the level of details of the output JSON file.
- Readme, Parepare_Your_Planner, and compile.sh suggests running the start-kit under repo root directory.
- Simplified duplicated output appears in couts and log files
- Updated documentation (add more descriptions regarding the coordination system in Prepare_Your_Planner.md)
- Updated documentation (add corresponding descriptions of `OutputScreen` in Input_Output_Format.md)
- Terminate all processes when the main process (the simulation) is terminated.

Fixed:
- Fixed issue with running start-kit under repo root directory python cannot find compiled MAPF module for importing.
- Fixed issue with missing fie_storage_path for pybind.
