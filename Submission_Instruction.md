# Submission Instruction

Read the start-kit [README.md](./README.md) and [Prepare_Your_Planner.md](./Prepare_Your_Planner.md) to know what files you should (not) modify, and how you could implement your algorithm.

When your implementation is ready to evaluate, add, commit, and push all your changes by running the following commands in your local repo:
```
$ git add [modified/new created files]
$ git commit -m "Some message to describe this commit."
$ git push origin
```

## Evaluate your algorithm

Once you commit your implementation to your submission repo you can begin the evaluation process. 
From the competition website, navigate to the My Submission Page. Here you will be able to see details of your entry and submission history (make sure you are logged in!). 

You can evaluate a specific branch under `Evaluate the Branch`, this allows for different algorithms or variant features.

Then click the `Start Evaluation` button on this page to evaluate your new submission.

## Track evaluation progress and history submission

You can find a `My Submissions` panel on My Submission Page.
Click the info button on an entry to see the details and track the progress of a running evaluation.
